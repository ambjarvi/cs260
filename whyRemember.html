            <div>Hi! My name's Amber, and I love everything about life! I love trying new things! While serving as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ in Peru, I tested my limits by exploring and adapting to a whole new culture! Whether abroad or in the same small town, everyone has a story! During my mission I developed the habit of writitng in my journal every day. Now that I'm a college student, it's hard to find the time. Between every assignment, shift at work, and sliver of a social life, I found it difficult to continue my beloved hobby! That's when I was given the idea to write a short sentance of my day on my calendar. I might not have a full 30 minutes, but I definatly have 10 seconds. I realized how the time I spent on journaling didnt matter as much as just doing something! Weither you want to create big Journal entries, or only a sentance or two, this application is for you! It's time to remember you day, and write your story, one day at a time!</div>
