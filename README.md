## Remember my Day

### Elevator Pitch

I'm sure you've been told before that you need to journal. After all, you don't want to forget the best years of your life! The problem is: who has the time? What do you even write? With 'Remember my Day' you can follow one of our quick prompts, and in a minute or less write something significant that you can look back on forever. Journaling is what you make of it! It can be about writing what you had for lunch, small things you learned, or a new friend you made. It's time to start remembering your day!
