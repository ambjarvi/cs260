# Midterm notes

1. In the following code, what does the link element do?

The <link> element is used to link external resources, typically stylesheets, to an HTML document. It helps in applying styles and layouts to the document.
2. In the following code, what does a div tag do?

The <div> tag is a block-level element used for grouping and structuring content within an HTML document. It is often styled with CSS to create layout structures.
3. In the following code, what is the difference between the #title and .grid selector?

#title is an ID selector and refers to a specific HTML element with the id attribute of "title." It selects one unique element.
.grid is a class selector and refers to one or more HTML elements with the class attribute of "grid." It can select multiple elements.
4. In the following code, what is the difference between padding and margin?

Padding is the space inside an element, between its content and the element's border. It affects the element's size and content layout.
Margin is the space outside an element, around its border, and affects the spacing between elements.
5. Given this HTML and this CSS how will the images be displayed using flex?

Let's say you have HTML like this:
html
Copy code
<div class="image-container">
  <img src="image1.jpg">
  <img src="image2.jpg">
  <img src="image3.jpg">
</div>
And your CSS like this:
css
Copy code
.image-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
In this example, the images will be displayed in a row with equal spacing between them, due to the use of display: flex and justify-content: space-between.
6. What does the following padding CSS do?

Consider this CSS:
css
Copy code
.box {
  padding: 20px;
This CSS applies 20 pixels of padding on all sides (top, right, bottom, and left) of the element with the class "box." It creates space between the element's content and its border.
7. What does the following code using arrow syntax function declaration do?

Imagine the following JavaScript code:
javascript
Copy code
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
This code defines a function named add using arrow function syntax. It takes two parameters (a and b) and returns their sum. It's a concise way of defining functions.
8. What does the following code using map with an array output?

Let's say you have this JavaScript code:
javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
This code uses the map function to double each element in the numbers array. The doubled array will contain [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].
9. What does the following code output using getElementById and addEventListener?

Consider the HTML:
html
Copy code
<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
And the JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
This code adds a click event listener to the button with the ID "myButton." When the button is clicked, it triggers an alert that says "Button clicked!"
10. What does the following line of JavaScript do using a # selector?
- Imagine this line of JavaScript:
javascript const heading = document.querySelector("#mainHeading"); This code selects the HTML element with the ID "mainHeading." It retrieves the element, allowing you to manipulate or access its properties in your JavaScript code.

11. **Which of the following are true? (mark all that are true about the DOM)**
   - The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects.
   - The DOM allows JavaScript to access and manipulate the content and structure of an HTML document.

     ```css
     p::first-line {
       color: green;
     }
     ```

17. **What will the following code output when executed using a for loop and console.log?**

     - First-level Heading: `<h1>`
     - Third-level Heading: `<h3>`

20. **How do you declare the document type to be HTML?**
    - You declare the document type for an HTML document using a document type declaration (DOCTYPE) at the beginning of the HTML document. For HTML5, it is declared as follows:
      ```html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      ```

21. **What is valid JavaScript syntax for if, else, for, while, switch statements?**
    - Here's the valid syntax for these control structures in JavaScript:
      - `if` statement:

        if (condition) {
          // Code to execute if condition is true
        } else {
          // Code to execute if condition is false
        }
        ```

      - `for` loop:
        ```javascript
        for (initialization; condition; update) {
          // Code to execute in each iteration
        }
        ```

      - `while` loop:
        ```javascript
        while (condition) {
          // Code to execute as long as the condition is true
        }
        ```

      - `switch` statement:
        ```javascript
        switch (expression) {
          case value1:
            // Code to execute if expression equals value1
            break;
          case value2:
            // Code to execute if expression equals value2
            break;
          default:
            // Code to execute if expression doesn't match any case
        }
        ```
Here are answers to the next set of questions:

22. **What is the correct syntax for creating a JavaScript object?**
   - You can create a JavaScript object using either of the following syntaxes:
     - Object Literal: `const obj = {}`
     - Constructor Function: `const obj = new Object()`
     - Class (ES6+): 
       ```javascript
       class MyClass {
         constructor() {
           this.property = value;
         }
       }

       ```

23. **Is it possible to add new properties to JavaScript objects?**
   - Yes, you can dynamically add new properties to JavaScript objects by simply assigning values to them. For example: `object.newProperty = "new value";`

24. **If you want to include JavaScript on an HTML page, which tag do you use?**
   - To include JavaScript in an HTML page, you use the `<script>` tag. You can place JavaScript code directly within the `<script>` tag or link to an external JavaScript file using the `src` attribute.

25. **Given the following HTML, what JavaScript could you use to set the text "animal" to "crow" and leave the "fish" text unaffected?**
   - To change the text "animal" to "crow" and leave "fish" unaffected in the following HTML:

     <p id="myText">animal fish</p>
     ```
     You can use this JavaScript:
     ```javascript
     const textElement = document.getElementById("myText");
     textElement.innerHTML = textElement.innerHTML.replace("animal", "crow");
     ```

26. **Which of the following correctly describes JSON?**
   - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format used for data storage and exchange between a server and a client, or between different systems. It is a text-based, human-readable format and closely resembles JavaScript object literal notation. JSON is used for configuration files, data transmission, and more.
